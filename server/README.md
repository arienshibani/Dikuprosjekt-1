## Usage
---
### Specific question types
3 question types, each have their own endpoint for micromanagment.
`/api/v1/dropdown`  
`/api/v1/multichoice`  
`/api/v1/fillin`  
#### GET
Get to any of the 3 endpoints will return all questions of that type.  


#### POST
**Requires Authorization**  
Adds a question to any of the endpoints.  There is a type lock on all of them to 
prevent sending wrong types and fields.

#### PUT
**Requires Authorization**  
Changes one or more questions by providing a body with a old and new field.  e.g:
```json
{
    "old": {
        "_id": "someid"
    },
    "new": {
        "question_text": "the new value for question_text to given id"
    }
}
```
Any fields can be used in both old and new to select one or multiple questions, and edit multiple fields.

---
### By id
The id let's you get or delete a specific question
`/api/v1/dropdown/<id>`  
`/api/v1/multi_choice/<id>`  
`/api/v1/fill_in/<id>` 

#### GET
Returns the question that matches the id

#### DELETE
**Requires Authorization**  
Deletes the question with the matching id

---

### Sets
Return a set of a specific question type, with a limit.  
`/api/v1/dropdown/set/<limit>`  
`/api/v1/multi_choice/set/<limit>`  
`/api/v1/fill_in/set/<limit>` 

#### GET
Returns a list of questions.  The limit decides how many entires the list contains.  
Specifying a limit higher than available questions will error.  The list is randomized.


These endpoints also support queries for filtering questions.  
**Example:**  
`GET /api/v1/dropdown/set/2?difficulty=2`  

Support multiple queries  
**Example:**  
`GET /api/v1/dropdown/set/2?difficulty=2&tags=loops`

Support lists in queries by seperating with `,`  
**Example:**  
`GET /api/v1/dropdown/set/2tags=loops,operators`


### Questions endpoint
This is the main endpoint for getting question sets.
It uses queries to determine how many of each question type is requested

`/api/v1/questions`  

#### GET
**Example:**
`GET /api/v1/questions?dropdown=2&multichoice=1`  

This will request a set of 2 random dropdown questions and 1 multichoice question.

This endpoint also support filter queries.

**Example:**
`GET /api/v1/questions/?dropdown=3&tags=loops,lists&difficulty=3`

This will return a set of 3 dropdown questions that contain either loops or lists, with a difficulty of 3.  Multiple tags only increase what to look for, it's not an `and this` look up.

#### POST
**Requires Authorization**  

Same as posting to the specific question endpoint, but requires that you specify which type of question it is with the `type` field


`api/v1/questions/:id`

#### DELETE
Same as deleting to a specific endpoint, but since the ids are unique you dont have to specify type with this.
